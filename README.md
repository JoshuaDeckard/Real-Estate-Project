# React and Tailwind Real Estate Project

This repository contains a practice Real Estate Project completed during the summer of 2023. 

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project was to further improve my web development skills by building a practical website. Throughout the process, I enhanced my React and Tailwind CSS knowledge. I was also able to refine my proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The original project, created byCristian Mihai(GitHub:(https://github.com/cristianmihai01)), served as a great learning resource. I fixed certain issues and bugs that were present in the original source code, particularly those related to responsive design. I fixed minor issues, such as misaligned price range selections and unintended borders on the header, which improved user experience among other things. 

## Key Achievments
- Designed a practical website using React and Tailwind CSS
- Strengthened my modular programming skills by splitting up the website into components. This made the code more maintainable.
- Resolved bugs and formatting issues present in the source code
- Made the website more responsive on smaller devices
